# 🎯 PRIORITY FOCUS - What Actually Matters

## ⚡ **TL;DR: Focus on the DEMO VIDEO (80% of winning)**

Test:
User: "Send $50 to Alice"

```
Goal: Deployed contract that works

## 📞 **When Things Go Wrong:**

### **Common Issues:**

**"AI is too slow"**
```
Solution:
- Use streaming responses
- Cache common requests
- Optimize prompt
- Switch to faster model
```

**"Smart contract won't deploy"**
```
Solution:
- Check Arc testnet RPC
- Verify wallet has testnet USDC
- Ask Person 1 for help
- Use existing deployed contract
```

**"Frontend can't connect to backend"**
```
Solution:
- Check CORS settings
- Verify API endpoint
- Test with curl first
- Check browser console
```

**"Running out of time"**
```
Solution:
- Cut features (3 → 1 scenario)
- Focus on demo video
- Skip polish
- Just make it work
```
